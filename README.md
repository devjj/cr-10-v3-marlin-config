# cr-10-v3-marlin-config

My configuration for Marlin 2.x and my CR-10 V3

Forked from: https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Configurations/tree/import-2.0.x/config/examples/Creality/CR-10%20V2

**Note: I have not tested this configuration yet for an entire print. I had some unrelated issues with my printer initially so use at your own risk. I will update this later once I've completed a test print.**
